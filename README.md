# DevOps Internship Projects - Elevate Labs 🚀

Hello Team Elevate Labs,

I’m **Chitturi Sri Jaya Venkata Surya**, and I’m excited to submit the projects I’ve completed during my DevOps Internship with you. These tasks were not just assignments — they became stepping stones in shaping my practical DevOps skills. I took up **4 projects** instead of the recommended 1 or 2, because I was truly passionate about the learning involved.

Although I planned to do 6 projects, I encountered some unexpected personal issues. However, I'm proud of the 4 quality projects I completed and submitted with full dedication. Every task was done from scratch, error-free, with detailed research and implementation.
